# QR-Code-Generator
This project is a simple QR code generator that prompts the user for a URL, generates a QR code image from the URL, and saves both the QR code image and the URL to files. It is implemented using Node.js and utilizes the inquirer package for user input, the qr-image package for QR code generation, and the fs package for file system operations.
